<p><p>The first project is to download and install software modular synthesizer, then verify that sound can be heard.</p>
<p>While the task sounds fairly straight forward, this establishes a baseline from which all other exercises derives from and allows everyone to participate with the same tooling.</p>
<p>WHile there are multiple options available, there are two no-cost software modular synthesizers that I would like to highlight, each with their own unique ecosystem of users and support.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV Rack 2 Free</a> is a no-cost open-source modular synthesizer. There is a Rack 2 Pro version; its use is not required for this course.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.cherryaudio.com/bundles/voltage-modular-nucleus">Voltage Modular Nucleus</a> is a no-cost closed-source modular synthesizer. There are paid versions with a much greater number of modules; their use is not required for this course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both tools have similar capabilities, labeling and interfaces, but has distinct differences in mission and design. I highly recommend trying both.</p>
<p>This course will focus on the use of VCV Rack 2, but will attempt to support both equally.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download VCV Rack 2 Free - <a href="https://vcvrack.com/Rack">vcvrack.com/Rack</a></li>
<li>Install it - <a href="https://vcvrack.com/manual/Installing">vcvrack.com/manual/Installing</a></li>
<li>Open it</li>
<li>Find the &quot;AUDIO&quot; module (upper-right corner)</li>
<li>Choose an audio driver (default will probably be fine) and device (specific to your computer).</li>
<li>Press <code>Z</code> on your keyboard; a note should be heard.</li>
<li>Press (in order) <code>ZSXDCVGBHNJM,</code>; a chromatic scale should be heard.</li>
</ol>
